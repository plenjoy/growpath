* Underappreciated movies you missed in 2018

    >I Kill Giants

    >Adapted from writer Joe Kelly and artist J. M. Ken Niimura's graphic novel I Kill Giants, Danish director Anders Walter's adaptation stars The Conjuring 2 actress Madison Wolfe as the pint-sized but plucky Barbara Thorson, an oddball outsider who constantly has her head in the clouds, a pair of bunny ears on top of her blonde mop, and a Norse war hammer in her bag. You see, Barbara fancies herself a killer of giants, and is convinced that a horde of them — along with a flurry of other fantasy creatures — are coming to Earth and that she's the only one who can vanquish them when they arrive. But Barbara's introversion, middle school ostracism, and obsession with Dungeons & Dragons aren't the only things that foster her overactive imagination. The young dreamer uses her world of fantasy as a means of escaping the difficulties she faces at home. 

    >Blending together an impactful coming-of-age tale, themes of grief and denial, gorgeous magical realism, solid CGI, and captivating performances from Wolfe and supporting actors Imogen Poots, Zoe Saldana, and Sydney Wade, I Kill Giants is a magnificent monster movie that's monstrously moving. Critics have applauded it as "never less than engrossing," and you'll agree.
